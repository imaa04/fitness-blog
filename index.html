<h2>Get The Look That You Want</h2>

<p>Are you new to the fitness world and don't know where to start? <br>
Then this blog is written for you. I used to be in that same position <br>
where losing weight was my ultimate goal but didn't want to join any gym,<br>
cause I used to be intimidated by it and shy to workout in front of others.<br>
Or finding the idea of healthy dieting unachievable since I was so used to <br>
eating fast and processed food. But if I could do it, I know you can too! <br>
Welcome to my blog and hope you find my way of introducing myself to fitness<br>
helps you aswell like it did to me  </p>

<h2>Confidence is important</h2>
<p>Engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviours, such as physical activity <br>
    or following a healthy diet, is associated with positive self-esteem <br>
    and mental health. It is proven that Endorphines (hormones that boost your mood)<br>
    are released when you eat healthy and exercise regurarly.<br>
    You propably thinkng how are you supposed to be happy when you are not allowed to have<br>
    your favourite food or sweating in pain during your workouts.<br>
    I had such thoughts at my starting point but getting the thought of the confidence you will<br>
    achieve after reaching your goal is what can help you throughout the process.<br>
    Thinking of why you have set such goals, the outcome and what you're going to do<br>
    with the outcome.
