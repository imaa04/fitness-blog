        <h2>Only 20% of your results come from your workouts. Even though diet has more effect on your change, workouts do help with boosting your results. Since I've started my weight loss journey during Covid 19 Pandemics, gyms were closed down but even if they were to be open, I used to be quite intimidated and shy to enter one. Thankfully I've came across popular youtube videos from popular fitness youtubers(which became a trend to do back in pandemic times) that I followed and seen results.

            Chloe ting is one of the main program I've followed which you can find in her website <a href ="https://chloeting.com/">Chloe Ting</a>
            
            I have followed the 2020 Hourglass Workout program  which is 28 days long. If you want a shorter program there are such programs available.</h2>
