<p>to make paragraphs</p>

some tags dont need closing
<br> Line break
<img>
<!--this is how to cooment (command /)-->
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<a href="https.//google.com">Google</a>
<!-- This link opens in a new page href is an attribute to html -->
<!-- if you want to connect relative file path inside the same folder
e.g second.html notes in web_project folder wite a href="second.html"<a> -->
<!-- put target to open a new tab same browser-->
<a href = "https.//google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>

<!-- <img src="url"> called hotlinking to not do that caus website can be deleted and picture wont show up anymore -->
<!-- save the picture in computer <img src='fish.jpg' alt+'picture offish'> -->

<!-- HTML is the language we use to annotate content so browsers know how to render it. Without html, text will just show up as plain, small letters and images wouldn't show. -->
​
<!-- HTML is a mark up language - this means it uses words or symbols to control display and formatting 
In HTML, these symbols are called tags. Tags are structured:
<opening tag> Content you want to have the properties of the tag</closingtag>
​
Typically we surround the content with our tags, and this makes an element. The browser will render the content with the properties of the tag we used. For example:
​
A paragraph element. We surround our content so the browser knows what bits of our content need which properties -->
<p>Hello everyone hope you had a lovely weekend</p>
<!-- paragraphs are BLOCK elements, by default nothing will sit next to them -->

<!-- Heading elements, from 1-6. By using these tag names, our browsers knows
- how to render them visually
- how important they are to the page
- if a screen reader should add emphasis or focus to the words
- and they might provide information to bot crawlers or spiders about the page content, which could help search engines find your work -->
<h1>This is a heading - heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a heading - heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a heading - heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is a heading - heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is a heading - heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is a heading - heading 6</h6>
<!-- Headings are also BLOCK elements - nothing will sit next to them by default -->
​
<!-- This is an anchor tag, which we usually use to make hyperlinks. For them to work properly, we need to specify some properties! These properties are known as attributes. Tags already have associated attributes, but we can almost fill-in the gaps! 
​
The <a> tag tells the broswer the following content is an anchor tag - it will anchor to another location, but it is the href attribute that tells the browser what that location is-->
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
<!-- target blank is another attribute - it tells the browser where in itself to open up that link. In the same window? In the same tab? In a new tab? If we're linking to an external website, opening in a new tab is good practise, because it keeps the user on our website-->
<a href="second.html">Go to my second page</a>
<!-- For an internal link, we don't need a full url - we don't even have that yet! Instead we need a relative file path. From where we are, how do we get to the new page?
​
Links are INLINE elements - they appear on the same line as the content around them if possible. Nothing in their default styling tells them to sit on a new line!
 -->
<a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/low-maintenance-freshwater-fish-4770223" target="_blank">
<img src="images/bettafish.webp" alt="A picture of a male betta veiltail with red and blue colouring">
</a>
<!-- The above code is a bit of a mixture! We're having a link to another website, but rather than the content that is the link be text, it's an image!
​
img is a standalone tag, it is self closing. We need to tell the browser to make way for the image, and we use the attributes to give it more properties. src is the source of the image
​
alt is "alternative" and is useful to give a back up for if the image doesn't load, or can't be rendered. Its useful for accessbility. People who have visual impairments may navigate with a screenreader. Screenreaders can't describe images, so they'll read out the alt text instead!-->

​
<!-- Another common element is the list element. We have two types of list -->
<ol>
    <li>A list item</li>
    <li>A list item</li>
    <li>A list item</li>
    <li>A list item</li>
</ol>
<!-- This is an ordered list - the items will be numbered starting at 1. Notice where the <ol> tags open and close. They surround the <li> elements. li stands for list item. ol is the parent element. Every <li> is a child of <ol>, and a sibling of eachother
    
ul is an unordered list. List items just appear with a bullet point next to them, rather than a number-->
<ul>
    <li>A list item</li>
    <li>A list item</li>
    <li>A list item</li>
    <li>A list item</li>
</ul>
​
<!-- When it comes to laying out our pages, the <div> element comes in really handy. It allows us to group content together. This content may share similar styling, or need to be laid out in a certain way, so we can control the div rather than each individual element -->
<div>
    <p>This paragraph is within a div</p>
    <ul>
        <li>So</li>
        <li>Is</li>
        <li>This</li>
        <li>List</li>
    </ul>
</div>
​
<!-- Now, if we want to move that content around the page with CSS, or style it, we can style the div rather than the p,ul, and li elements individually. Visually, you won't see div doing much, it's just a block. -->
